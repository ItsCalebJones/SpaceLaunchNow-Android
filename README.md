# SpaceLaunchNow
A space launch tracker for Android using data from the Launch Library API provided by The Space Devs.

## Data Sources

A majority of the data is currently sourced from [Launch Libary](https://thespacedevs.com/) a wonderful set of API's and Librarians that are constantly tracking and updating launches around the world. Additionally I utilize [Space Launch Now - Server](https://github.com/ItsCalebJones/SpaceLaunchNow-Server) to provide additional vehicle data and push notifications for launch times.

## Translations
Space Launch Now is now translated into five languages, huge thanks to those that have contributed. If you are interested in helping improve the translations feel free to take a look [here](https://spacelaunchnow.oneskyapp.com).
